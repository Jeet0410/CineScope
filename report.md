## 1. Introduction
CineScope is a web-based media information database designed to provide users with comprehensive details on movies, TV shows, and actors. The platform enhances the user experience through features such as search, review, and rating capabilities, with a unique focus on supporting independent filmmakers. By using MVC architecture, CineScope creates a seamless interaction environment, allowing users to engage with both mainstream and indie content.

## 2. Design Problem

### 2.1 Problem Definition
- The project addresses the need for a media platform where users can search, review, and rate various media while supporting indie filmmakers. CineScope aims to fill a gap in the market by providing an interactive, community-driven experience that caters to both mainstream audiences and indie creators.

### 2.2 Project Charter
- The project objectives include developing a functional media information database with an MVC structure, a user-friendly interface, and secure API integration for real-time media updates. We have included privacy and security measures in compliance with GDPR standards to protect user data.

## 3. Solution

### 3.1 Solution 1
[This initial approach involved building a media information database with core features like browsing and rating media content. The API integration provided real-time updates, while a simple UI allowed basic user interaction. However, limitations such as the lack of indie support, minimal user engagement features, and insufficient privacy measures led to exploring an improved solution.]: #

### 3.2 Solution 2
[The second iteration introduced support for independent filmmakers, enhanced interactivity (e.g., user profiles, reviews, favorites tracking), and performance optimization through load balancing. Privacy and regulatory compliance were achieved with secure login and GDPR-aligned data handling. Though Solution 2 increased project costs, an MVP approach helped manage expenses.]: #

[### 3.3 Final Solution
Solution 2 was selected as the final design due to its comprehensive feature set, user engagement enhancements, and alignment with design constraints. The final solution provides CineScope with a unique appeal, balancing functionality and compliance with user needs and privacy standards.]:#

[## 4. Team Work
Our team utilized weekly meetings to assign and track tasks, ensuring progress through each project phase. Each member contributed to various aspects, including design, development, and testing, while maintaining clear communication and accountability through GitHub.]:#

[## 5. Project Management
A milestone-based schedule, tracked via GitHub and supported by weekly updates, was implemented to ensure timely completion. The schedule accounted for design, development, and testing phases, with a Gantt chart visualizing progress and identifying critical tasks.]:#

[## 6. Conclusion and Future Work
The iterative design approach allowed us to refine CineScope to meet user needs while staying within project constraints. Future enhancements could include expanded user interactivity, additional content filtering options, and partnerships with more indie creators to strengthen CineScopeâ€™s unique offering.]: #
